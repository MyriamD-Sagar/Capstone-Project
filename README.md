# CustomerAttrition Prediction - Capstone Project

## Bank Customer Attrition Prediction Application 
Stand-alone application developed using a Python programming environment for WGU Capstone project.  
The first part of this program consists of exploring and preprocessing the data through a dashboard, including visualization tools such as tables, graphs, and matrices.
These descriptive methods allow users to visualize and understand the relations and correlations between customers’ features. It also features the data preprocessing steps like handling missing values and categorical variables, splitting the data into training and test sets, and balancing the dataset.
Next, the dashboard presents the steps to develop and improve the prediction model utilizing a robust machine learning (ML) classification algorithm to generate predictions on customer attrition.
The subsequent portion of the application’s console consists of an analysis of the accuracy of the model presented using visualization tools.


The last section is the user interface.
It displays labeled text boxes where employees can input a customer’s information.
Then, the user has to click on the button “Predict” to produce an output label indicating whether the customer will stay or leave the bank.
This prediction is be possible because the developed model mentioned above has been integrated into the user interface. The classification algorithm is trained with the processed data, allowing it to generate a prediction using the user’s inputs.
